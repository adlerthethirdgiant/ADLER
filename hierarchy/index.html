<i>Every racer here has the potential to rise through the ranks. 
        Your position isn't about where you are today—it's about the effort you contribute and the growth you choose to pursue. To advance in rank, you'll need to complete special task missions that demonstrate your skills and dedication to the team. Each race you complete, each teammate you support, and each mission you accomplish moves you forward. We're all working together toward something greater, and there's a place for everyone to shine. 
        Your journey up the ranks begins with your next mission. Keep pushing forward—we believe in you.. </i>
