      Hello everyone,
    </p>

    <p>
      As your team captain, I believe in the importance of transparency and sharing our
      journeys together. Since I started playing Nitro Type in October 2022, I have
      learned a lot about typing, racing, and improving my skills. I want to share my
      progress with you to inspire and encourage everyone on our team.

    <h2>My Journey</h2>

    <p>
      <strong>Initial Skills:</strong> When I first began playing, I focused on mastering
      the basics of typing. I quickly learned the QWERTY and Homerow keys, which laid the
      foundation for my typing speed.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Current Progress:</strong> I’m proud to say that my highest recorded typing
      speed is 122 WPM. This achievement reflects my dedication and practice over the past
      few years.
    </p>

  <section class="card" style="border-left: 3px solid #e63946;">
    <h2>Recent Changes</h2>

    <p>
      <strong>New Challenges:</strong> As of 2025, I decided to switch to the Dvorak
      keyboard layout. This has required a lot of adjustment and practice, but I believe
      it will ultimately enhance my typing efficiency and speed.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Stat Sharing:</strong> To back up my claims, I’m sharing my stats here for
      everyone to see. I encourage each of you to do the same, as it creates a culture of
      openness and motivation within our team.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="card" style="border-left: 3px solid #e6b800;">
    <h2>Why This Matters</h2>

    <p>
      <strong>Inspiration:</strong> By sharing my journey, I hope to inspire each of you
      to embrace your own paths to improvement.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Community Building:</strong> Openly discussing our stats fosters a sense of
      camaraderie. We can learn from one another and celebrate our successes together.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Accountability:</strong> This transparency holds me accountable to all of
      you and encourages me to continually strive for improvement.
    </p>

    <p>
      Together, as a team, we can support each other in our goals and become even better
      racers and typists. I’m looking forward to hearing about your journeys and stats too!
