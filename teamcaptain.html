    Hey Adlerians,
    </p>

    <p>
    I want to be real with you all. As our team keeps growing, 
      I think you deserve to know the full story behind where we are today.
    </p>

    <h2>My Journey</h2>

    <p>
I started Nitro Type on October 3rd, 2022, knowing absolutely nothing about proper typing. I learned QWERTY from scratch, drilled the homerow until my fingers hurt, and raced constantly to build speed. By April 1st, 2023, I hit my personal best of 122 WPM—every single word earned through practice, not shortcuts.
I need you to know: I've never used an auto-typer or any bot. This team was built the hard way—blood, sweat, and tears. 
      Every stat you see from me is legitimate, and that's a promise I make to each of you.
    </p>

    <h2>Where I Am Now?</h2>

    <p>
In Sep 2025, I made the tough decision to switch to Dvorak layout. My speeds have dropped significantly while I relearn everything, but I'm committed to the long-term benefits. 
      It's humbling, honestly, but it reminds me that improvement is always possible.

    <h2>Why I'm Sharing This?</h2>

    <p>
      <strong>Honesty:</strong> You deserve a captain who leads by example and tells the truth
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Community Building:</strong>When we're open about our struggles and wins, we grow stronger together
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Accountability:</strong> This transparency holds me accountable to all of
      you and encourages me to continually strive for improvement.
    </p>

    <p>
My stats are posted here for anyone to verify. 
      I encourage you all to share yours too—not to compete, but to celebrate how far we've all come.
    </p>
    <p>
This team matters to me. You all matter to me. Let's keep building something we can be proud of.
